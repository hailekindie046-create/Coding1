        <h2>Coding is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and follow. </h2>
          <p>hese instructions are written in programming languages like HTML, Python, JavaScript, or C++. Coding allows<br> 
            us to create websites, apps, games, and even control robots or automate tasks. It helps solve real-world<br>
            problems by telling machines what to do step by step. For beginners, learning to code might seem<br> 
            challenging at first, but with practice and curiosity, it becomes a powerful and creative tool to build almost<br> 
            anything.</p>
